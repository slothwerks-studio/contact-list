# My Contacts
## A mobile-first application for storing contact information and notes.

### What is this?
This is a web application designed to run on your phone.  With this app, you may add new contacts to a contact list, then call them from the application itself by selecting the name of the contact in the list.  [Try it for yourself](https://slothwerks-studio.github.io/contact-list/)!

### Why did you build this?
This public repository was built to teach the basic fundamentals of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application.

### How do I check out the code?

#### File download
The easiest method is to simply download the files to your computer.

- Click on the code download button on this repo and select Download ZIP.
- Save the ZIP package to the desktop of your computer.
- Once downloaded, [extract the files](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/) to your desktop.  This should create a new folder called `contact-list-main`, but you can rename it to whatever you like.

#### Forking the repository
It's lovely to play with the code on your own machine.  But let's say you'd like to share your code updates.  What then?

[Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) creates a copy of the repo within your personal GitHub account.  This allows you to take advantage of revision history, code collaboration, and the many other benefits of using [git](https://git-scm.com/).  You may also make a request to the original repo owner to add updates from your copy of the repo.

So...

- If you have not already done so, [create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join).  It's free!
- After creating an account, come back to this repo and click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner (just beneath the navigation bar).
- GitHub will make a copy of the repo, then re-direct you to your fork of `contact-list`.
- Next, [clone the code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in order to access it on your local machine.

When working with git, you'll want to get comfortable using a terminal program such as [zsh for Mac](https://www.howtogeek.com/682770/how-to-open-the-terminal-on-a-mac/) or [PowerShell for Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/662611/9-ways-to-open-powershell-in-windows-10/).  This will allow you to run the commands necessary to complete the above steps.
### How do I play with the code on my own computer?
Well, you'll want to install a nifty programming application such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Once installed, open the software.  Go to View > Extensions.
- In the extensions search bar, type "Live Server".  Select the Live Server extension by Ritwick Day in the results (it should be the top result).
- Click on the Install button.  Once installed, close VS Code and open it again.
- Go to File > Open Folder (Windows) or File > Open (Mac) and select the folder containing the project files.
- Once loaded, at the very bottom-right of the VS Code window you should see an option that says "Go Live".  Click on this; a new tab should appear in your browser with the application running.
- If you make changes to any of the project files, select File > Save.  The application should automatically reload within the browser, allowing you to access your changes immediately.

### I know a little HTML and CSS, but I don't know anything about JavaScript.  Help!
We got your back!  Sloth discussed the basic concepts of JavaScript and walked through the initial code at [GRWebDev](https://www.meetup.com/grwebdev/) in March of 2021.  You can check out the [video of his presentation](https://www.facebook.com/182139175163955/videos/455547239117005) on Facebook.  We will continue to work on the code throughout a number of events sponsored by GRWebDev and [SlothWerks](https://slothwerks.com/).

### This application seems kinda lame.
Well, that's because we haven't made many changes to it yet.  Let's work together to add new features and improve the app!
